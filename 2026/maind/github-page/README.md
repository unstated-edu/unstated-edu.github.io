## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign into your account.
- Click on "New repository".
- Name your repository ([unstated-edu.github.io](https://unstated-edu.github.io)) make sure has youraccountname.github.io
- Make sure the repository is public if you want others to be able to see your page.
- Click on "Create repository".

## Step 2: Prepare Your Files

- Ensure your website files are ready. At a minimum, you should have an `index.html` file.
- If you have sketches or JavaScript scripts, make sure they are properly included and linked in your HTML.

## Step 3: Upload Your Files

- On your new repository page on GitHub, find and click on "uploading an existing file" or "create new file".
- Drag and drop your files into the page or use the upload function.
- After uploading, write a commit message describing what you are uploading.
- Click on "Commit changes".

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to your repository settings (Settings).
- Scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Under "Source", select the branch where you uploaded your files, typically `main` or `master`.
- Click on "Save".
- GitHub will provide a URL, which will be the home of your site.

## Step 5: Test Your Site

- Open the URL provided by GitHub Pages on your phone to see how your site appears and how the sketches function.
- You can keep making changes to your files and push them to GitHub. Updates will appear by refreshing the page after a few minutes.

These instructions will help you quickly test your web projects on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.
